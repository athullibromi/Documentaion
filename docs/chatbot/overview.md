## How to Use the Chatbot

### Starting a Conversation
1. Click the chatbot icon in the bottom-right corner

### Best Practices
- **Be specific**: Instead of "How do I install?", try "How do I install the software on Windows?"
- **Use keywords**: Include relevant terms related to your question

### Example Questions
```
"How do I get started with the API?"
"What are the authentication requirements?"
"I'm getting a 401 error, what should I do?"
"Show me code examples for user management"
```
