## Integration Methods

Our software offers several methods to integrate with third-party services:

1. **Pre-built Connectors**: Ready-to-use integrations with popular services
2. **Webhook Integration**: Send and receive data via webhooks
3. **API Integration**: Use our API to build custom integrations
4. **OAuth Authentication**: Connect securely with third-party services

## Step 1: Access Integration Settings

1. Log in to the application with your administrator account
2. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations**
3. You'll see a list of available integration categories

## Step 2: Set Up a Pre-built Connector

Let's walk through setting up a Slack integration as an example:

1. In the Integrations dashboard, find "Slack" under Communication Tools
2. Click "Connect" or "Set Up"
3. You'll be redirected to Slack's authorization page
4. Sign in to your Slack workspace if needed
5. Review the permissions requested
6. Click "Allow" to authorize the connection
7. You'll be redirected back to our application
8. Configure integration-specific settings:
   - Select channels for notifications
   - Choose which events trigger Slack messages
   - Customize message formats
9. Click "Save Configuration"

## Step 3: Configure Webhook Integration

For services without pre-built connectors, you can use webhooks:

1. In the Integrations dashboard, click "Custom Webhook"
2. Click "Create New Webhook"
3. Configure the webhook:
   - Enter a name for the integration
   - Provide the webhook URL from the third-party service
   - Select events that should trigger the webhook
   - Configure the payload format if needed
4. Test the webhook by clicking "Send Test Event"
5. Verify that the third-party service received the test event
6. Click "Save Configuration"

## Step 4: API Integration

For more complex integrations, you can use our API:

1. Navigate to **Settings > API Access**
2. Generate a new API key if you don't have one
3. Copy your API key and keep it secure
4. Use our [API Documentation](/api-reference/authentication) to build your integration
5. Register your integration in **Settings > Integrations > Custom API Integration**

## Step 5: OAuth Authentication

To allow users to connect their own accounts:

1. In the Integrations dashboard, select the service you want to enable
2. Click "Configure OAuth"
3. Register an OAuth application with the third-party service
4. Enter the client ID and secret provided by the service
5. Configure redirect URLs
6. Set permission scopes
7. Save the configuration
8. Users can now connect their accounts from their profile settings

## Common Integration Examples

### Salesforce Integration

1. Navigate to **Integrations > CRM Systems > Salesforce**
2. Click "Connect"
3. Log in to your Salesforce account
4. Configure data mapping:
   - Map user fields to Salesforce contacts
   - Configure lead creation rules
   - Set up opportunity tracking
5. Set up bi-directional sync options
6. Configure sync frequency
7. Click "Save Configuration"

### Slack Notifications

1. Navigate to **Integrations > Communication Tools > Slack**
2. Click "Connect" and authorize
3. Configure notification settings:
   - New user registrations
   - Important system alerts
   - Report completions
   - Custom events
4. Customize message templates
5. Select destination channels
6. Click "Save Configuration"

### Google Analytics

1. Navigate to **Integrations > Analytics > Google Analytics**
2. Click "Connect"
3. Log in to your Google account
4. Select your Google Analytics property
5. Configure tracking options:
   - Page views
   - Events
   - User properties
   - Custom dimensions
6. Add tracking code to custom pages if needed
7. Click "Save Configuration"

## Troubleshooting Integration Issues

### Authentication Failures

1. Verify API keys and secrets are correct
2. Check that OAuth tokens haven't expired
3. Confirm that the integration has the necessary permissions
4. Look for changes in the third-party API that might affect the integration

### Data Sync Issues

1. Check sync logs in **Integrations > Logs**
2. Verify field mappings are correct
3. Look for data format incompatibilities
4. Check for rate limiting issues

### Webhook Delivery Problems

1. Verify the webhook URL is correct and accessible
2. Check that the receiving service is properly configured to accept webhooks
3. Review webhook logs for delivery attempts and responses
4. Test with a simple payload to isolate the issue

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with one or two critical integrations before adding more
2. **Monitor Performance**: Regularly check integration logs for errors or performance issues
3. **Update Regularly**: Keep integrations updated as third-party APIs evolve
4. **Secure Credentials**: Store API keys and secrets securely
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Always test integrations in a staging environment first
