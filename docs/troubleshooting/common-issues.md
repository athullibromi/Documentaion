- Timeouts occur during operations

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Clear browser cache and cookies
3. Disable browser extensions that might interfere
4. Check system resources (CPU, memory) on the server
5. Optimize database queries if you're an administrator
6. Consider upgrading your server resources

### High Memory Usage

**Symptoms:**
- System becomes unresponsive
- Error messages about memory limits
- Application crashes

**Solutions:**
1. Close unnecessary applications and browser tabs
2. Increase system memory if possible
3. Configure memory limits in the application settings
4. Optimize database queries and indexes
5. Implement data pagination for large datasets

## Data Import/Export Issues
