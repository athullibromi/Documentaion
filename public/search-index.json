    "content": "Third-Party Integrations\nThis guide explains how to integrate our software with popular third-party tools and services to extend functionality and streamline your workflows.\nPrerequisites\nBefore starting this tutorial, make sure you have:\n[ ] Completed the Installation Tutorial\n[ ] Completed the Configuration Guide\n[ ] Administrator access to the software\n[ ] Access to the third-party services you want to integrate with\nAvailable Integrations\nOur software supports integration with the following categories of third-party tools:\nCRM Systems\nSalesforce\nHubSpot\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365\nZoho CRM\nMarketing Platforms\nMailchimp\nMarketo\nHubSpot Marketing\nSendGrid\nCommunication Tools\nSlack\nMicrosoft Teams\nDiscord\nZoom\nProject Management\nJira\nAsana\nTrello\nMonday.com\nFile Storage\nGoogle Drive\nDropbox\nOneDrive\nBox\nAnalytics\nGoogle Analytics\nMixpanel\nAmplitude\nSegment\nIntegration Methods\nOur software offers several methods to integrate with third-party services:\nPre-built Connectors: Ready-to-use integrations with popular services\nWebhook Integration: Send and receive data via webhooks\nAPI Integration: Use our API to build custom integrations\nOAuth Authentication: Connect securely with third-party services\nStep 1: Access Integration Settings\nLog in to the application with your administrator account\nNavigate to Settings > Integrations\nYou'll see a list of available integration categories\nStep 2: Set Up a Pre-built Connector\nLet's walk through setting up a Slack integration as an example:\nIn the Integrations dashboard, find \"Slack\" under Communication Tools\nClick \"Connect\" or \"Set Up\"\nYou'll be redirected to Slack's authorization page\nSign in to your Slack workspace if needed\nReview the permissions requested\nClick \"Allow\" to authorize the connection\nYou'll be redirected back to our application\nConfigure integration-specific settings:\nSelect channels for notifications\nChoose which events trigger Slack messages\nCustomize message formats\nClick \"Save Configuration\"\nStep 3: Configure Webhook Integration\nFor services without pre-built connectors, you can use webhooks:\nIn the Integrations dashboard, click \"Custom Webhook\"\nClick \"Create New Webhook\"\nConfigure the webhook:\nEnter a name for the integration\nProvide the webhook URL from the third-party service\nSelect events that should trigger the webhook\nConfigure the payload format if needed\nTest the webhook by clicking \"Send Test Event\"\nVerify that the third-party service received the test event\nClick \"Save Configuration\"\nStep 4: API Integration\nFor more complex integrations, you can use our API:\nNavigate to Settings > API Access\nGenerate a new API key if you don't have one\nCopy your API key and keep it secure\nUse our API Documentation to build your integration\nRegister your integration in Settings > Integrations > Custom API Integration\nStep 5: OAuth Authentication\nTo allow users to connect their own accounts:\nIn the Integrations dashboard, select the service you want to enable\nClick \"Configure OAuth\"\nRegister an OAuth application with the third-party service\nEnter the client ID and secret provided by the service\nConfigure redirect URLs\nSet permission scopes\nSave the configuration\nUsers can now connect their accounts from their profile settings\nCommon Integration Examples\nSalesforce Integration\nNavigate to Integrations > CRM Systems > Salesforce\nClick \"Connect\"\nLog in to your Salesforce account\nConfigure data mapping:\nMap user fields to Salesforce contacts\nConfigure lead creation rules\nSet up opportunity tracking\nSet up bi-directional sync options\nConfigure sync frequency\nClick \"Save Configuration\"\nSlack Notifications\nNavigate to Integrations > Communication Tools > Slack\nClick \"Connect\" and authorize\nConfigure notification settings:\nNew user registrations\nImportant system alerts\nReport completions\nCustom events\nCustomize message templates\nSelect destination channels\nClick \"Save Configuration\"\nGoogle
